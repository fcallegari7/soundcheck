			<p>The A Head Full of Dreams Tour was the seventh concert tour undertaken by British alternative rock band Coldplay, launched in support of their namesake seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams. Marking the band's return to large-scale venues, after the brief and intimate Ghost Stories Tour, the tour visited stadiums and arenas across five continents. The A Head Full of Dreams Tour boasted extensive laser light and pyrotechnic visuals similar to the Mylo Xyloto Tour, and also saw a reappearance of the Xylobands as a central part of the show's visual design. The tour consisted of eight legs, with a total of 124 shows across Latin America, where they performed for the first time since the Viva la Vida Tour, Europe, North America, where they embarked on their very first stadium tour of the United States, Oceania, and Asia. The first show of the tour was held at the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata in La Plata, Argentina, on 31 March 2016 and concluded at the same venue on 15 November 2017. Grossing $523,033,675, the tour is currently the third highest-grossing concert tour in history. A live album covering the tour, which was recorded during several shows, will be released in November 2017. A concert film, filmed in SÃ£o Paulo, will also be released.</p>

			<p>In November 2015, Coldplay announced the Latin American and European legs of the "A Head Full of Dreams Tour" through their official website, with 28 stadium shows confirmed across 14 countries in Europe and Latin America the next year. On 7 December 2015, a fourth and final date at Wembley Stadium, on Wed, 15 June 2016 was announced by the band. The following day, while being interviewed on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the band announced that the tour would also visit Asia and North America.</p>

			<p>On 7 April 2016, Coldplay announced 12 new arena dates in the United States. On 29 May 2016, the band will play a homecoming gig in Exeter in England as part of BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. They have also been announced as the first headliners at Glastonbury 2016, performing on Sunday 26 June. This will be the fourth time they've headlined the festival and sets a record for the most number of times a headliner has played. It was also announced that this would be their only festival performance in 2016. However, two more festivals are now on their tour agenda. While nothing has been announced nor confirmed as of yet, Coldplay has expressed an interest to visit less-visited countries during concert tours, such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal and a large amount of Asia, as well as Africa. No dates have been set currently. Further tour dates will be announced after the release of dates of Leg 2 in Europe. On 6 October 2016, it has been confirmed on Twitter that they will visit the United States again and Canada in the Summer of 2017. On 15 November 2016, the band posted a teaser on Facebook announcing an Asian leg in 2017 that would visit Singapore, Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.[13] A week later, Thailand was included in the leg. On 16 March 2017, Coldplay announced extra North American dates in Toronto, Edmonton, and Pasadena.</p>

			<p>On 25 August 2017, the Houston concert scheduled that night at NRG Stadium was originally postponed due to Hurricane Harvey. However, on 29 September, Coldplay decided to cancel the concert due to scheduling conflicts with the venue. As compensation, the band announced that ticket holders will receive priority access for the next time they play in Houston.</p>

			<p>Similar to the Mylo Xyloto Tour, the A Head Full of Dreams Tour is typically split into five parts; an introduction on the main "A-stage", a performance on the "B-stage", a second set on the A-stage, a set on the outward "C-stage", and finally an encore on the A-stage. Songs played on the A-stage are accompanied by the show's full laser light and pyrotechnic visuals, while performances on the B-stage are not accompanied by such, and songs played on the C-stage are strictly acoustic performances.</p>
